# Nodecellar Auto-scale Auto-heal Blueprint

This blueprint deploys a demo wine store application that is based on nodejs and mongodb using Cloudify.

## Compatibility

Tested with:
  * Cloudify 4.3.1


## Pre-installation steps

**Please note the following requirement for manager configuration.**

This example requires configuration of [multiple management (agent) networks](https://docs.cloudify.co/4.3.0/install_maintain/installation/installing-manager/#multi-network-management) upon installation of your Cloudify Manager.

The required name of the agent network is `external`, and should map to a public IP address. For example:

```bash
[centos@ip-10-10-4-47 ~]$ sudo grep "networks" /etc/cloudify/config.yaml
    networks: {default: 10.10.4.47, external: 54.67.45.103}
```

Upload the required plugins:

  * [Openstack Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-openstack-plugin/releases).
  * [AWSSDK Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-incubator/cloudify-awssdk-plugin/releases).
  * [AWS Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-aws-plugin/releases).
  * [GCP Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-incubator/cloudify-gcp-plugin/releases).
  * [Azure Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-incubator/cloudify-azure-plugin/releases).
  * [Utilities Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-incubator/cloudify-utilities-plugin/releases).
  * [Diamond Plugin](https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-diamond-plugin/releases).

_Check the blueprint for the latest version of the plugin._

Install the relevant example network blueprint for the IaaS that you wish to deploy on:

  * [Openstack Example Network](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/openstack-example-network)
  * [AWS Example Network](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/aws-example-network)
  * [GCP Example Network](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/gcp-example-network)
  * [Azure Example Network](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/azure-example-network)

Create required secrets list:

  > Secrets have duplicates due two deployments require different secrets

  * agent_key_private - private ssh key content
  * agent_key_public - public ssh key content
  * keystone_username - openstack/keystone username
  * keystone_password - openstack/keystone user's password

  * keystone_tenant_name - openstack/keystone project/tenant name
  * keystone_url - openstack/keystone auth url

  * openstack_region - openstack/keystone region name
  * openstack_tenant_name - openstack/keystone project/tenant name
  * openstack_username - openstack/keystone username
  * ubuntu_trusty_image - Ubuntu Trusty image ID


## Installation

On your Cloudify Manager, navigate to `Local Blueprints` select `Upload`.

[Right-click and copy URL](https://github.com/cloudify-examples/nodecellar-auto-scale-auto-heal-blueprint/archive/master.zip). Paste the URL where it says `Enter blueprint url`. Provide a blueprint name, such as `nodecellar` in the field labeled `blueprint name`.

Select the blueprint for the relevant IaaS you wish to deploy on, for example `openstack.yaml` from `Blueprint filename` menu. Click `Upload`.

After the new blueprint has been created, click the `Deploy` button.

Navigate to `Deployments`, find your new deployment, select `Install` from the `workflow`'s menu. At this stage, you may provide your own values for any of the default `deployment inputs`.


## Deployment Outputs

Once the workflow execution is complete, we can view the application endpoint by running: <br>

```shell
$ cfy deployments outputs nodecellar
```

You should see an output like this:

```shell
Retrieving outputs for deployment nodecellar...
 - "endpoint":
     Description: Web application endpoint
     Value: http://10.239.0.18:8080/
```

Use the URL from the endpoint output and visit that URL in a browser. Play with the wine store application.


## Autoscaling

Execute a benchmarking command line application to simulate an auto-scaling scenario.

```shell
$ ab -n 1000000 -c 200 http://10.239.0.18:8080/ # insert your URL instead of this one.
```

This will increase the number of requests to the application. As a result the CPU used by the node process on the nodejs_host VMs will spike above the scale up threshold. This metric is monitored by the Diamond plugin, and the Riemann auto-scale policy calls the scale workflow trigger.

Killing this command should cause the CPU to drop below the scale down threshold, and the application will scale down.

_Note: this assumes that the VM is an appropriate flavor for the benchmarking tool to sufficiently challenge the VM. This particular configuration is with a t2.micro AWS instance._

There are a number of ways to verify the scaling. If you have Cloudify Premium,  you will see the executions in Cloudify's UI.
You can also execute `cfy executions list` for a CLI view:

```shell
$ cfy executions list
Listing all executions...

```

## Simulate auto-healing

You can simulate a failed host by stopping or suspending a running nodejs_host VM. The Riemann failed host policy will recognize the lack of system cpu metrics reporting on the host and will trigger the heal workflow.


## Uninstallation

Navigate to the deployment and select `Uninstall`. When the uninstall workflow is finished, select `Delete deployment`.

```shell
$ cfy uninstall --allow-custom-parameters -p ignore_failure=true nodecellar
```
